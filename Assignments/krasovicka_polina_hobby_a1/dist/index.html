               <p>My whole life I was interested in different kinds of art.</p>
               <p>Since the young age I was experimenting and trying myself in various ways of self expression. I did decoupage, collage, tapestry, knitting, embroidery, mosaics etc. But most of all I always enjoyed drawing.</p>
               <p>I started to take drawing classes since age of 7 and continue to practice it today. When I was little it was my dream to become a painter. However, I never considered my paintings and drawings as good, which is why I kept doing it just as hobby.</p>
               <p>I don't draw as often as I wish I would, but I try doing it every other week.</p>

               <p><strong>What is the difference between drawing and painting?</strong></p>
               <p>The most clear distinction between these two mediums rests in the materials traditionally associated with each. Drawing usually implies working in pencil, pen, charcoal, pastel and even ink. Painting entails the use of a brush, palette knife or sponge and liquid paint.</p>
