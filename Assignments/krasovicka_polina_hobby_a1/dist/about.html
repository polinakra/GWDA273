               <p>New needs need new techniques. And the modern artists have found new ways and new means of making their statements... the modern painter cannot express this age, the airplane, the atom bomb, the radio, in the old forms of the Renaissance or of any other past culture.</p>

               <p>When I draw or paint it completely frees my mind and relaxes me. I focus on my art piece and forget about everything bad that could be on my mind.</p>
               <p>It is a way to distract myself from daily routine and let my mind be free, explore, dream and create something only for myself. I feel very happy when I draw. It is fun, good and healthy way to spend free time.</p>
               <p>I like painting an drawing in different styles. There many things that inspire me. Like animals, nature, fantasy creatures and different subjects overall.</p>
